Example of how to change a .data file to a csv file:





import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\Stephen\Downloads\abalone.data")
#.data file will open only in a text editor such as visual studio code

data.columns = ["Sex", "Length", "Diameter", "Height", "Whole-Weight", "Shucked_Weight", "Viscera_Weight", "Shell_Weight", "Rings"]
#find these on the .names file usually

data.to_csv(r"C:\Users\Stephen\Downloads\abalone.csv", index = None, header=True)
#can name file anything
